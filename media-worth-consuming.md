# really good stuff
  
* 2015-ish - *The Beginning of Infinity*, David Deutsch (2011) http://beginningofinfinity.com/
  * **update 2018-06-12**: best book ever written. incredibly consistent. breathtakingly profound.

    political philosophy, aesthetics, environmental philosophy
    
* 2017-late - *The Fountainhead*, Ayn Rand (1943) https://www.aynrand.org/novels/the-fountainhead
  * **update 2018-06-12**: deep book on the nature of integrity, relationships with others, the meaning and 
    purpose of one's actions (in the service of oneself and in the service of greater ideas / greatness).
    i've thought about this book quite a bit over the last 6 months, not only is there more to learn, but
    it's a source of great ideas to build on (esp with harder questions re: integrity).
  * tags: integrity, society, purpose, importance of explanation, morality, immorality, socialism, secondhandedness
  
# good stuff

* 2018-06-12 - *The $30,000 pocket dial*, Louis Rossmann (2013) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyZnKjFWrxo
  * it's important to go through these sorts of journeys. they butt up against reality, and
    you're forced to reconsider yourself and your ideas in search of improvement. 
    searching for improvement, and the desire to do so, is important.
