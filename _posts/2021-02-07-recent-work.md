I've been focusing on philosophy more lately.
During late January I decided to post my [self-unendorsement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hd1AmLPEyA).
I've been adding to my [curi.us microblog](https://curi.us/2380) regularly.
That is where you should go to find my latest work.
I post almost everything I produce to that thread.

For the past few days I have been doing making daily updates to [my makeup vlog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyqNe7EpSQmlGHB81-hzp-DZTFjVFVmWk)
and will continue doing that for the next week and a bit.
I've also created a vanity URL for the playlist: [https://xk.io/muv](https://xk.io/muv).
I link the playlist for these videos (and most videos individually) in my microblog, too.

I will continue posting to my microblog.
I consider my blog at xk.io mostly deprecated -- I don't anticipate posting much here until I find a new blog system.
