I've been doing a lot of work on philosophy recently.

Public work takes two main forms: [the tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nUP-Xqh_Dw&list=PLKx6lO5RmaetREa9-jt2T-qX9XO2SD0l2) are all up on youtube,
and [a site](https://xertrov.github.io/fi/) where I've been publishing related work.

* I've hired [Elliot Temple](https://www.elliottemple.com/) to tutor me with the ultimate goal of improving my writing.
* We discuss a lot of things in [the tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nUP-Xqh_Dw&list=PLKx6lO5RmaetREa9-jt2T-qX9XO2SD0l2); topics so far include grammar, text analysis, controlling and directing one's habits, time and energy managements, epistemology (including one of Elliot's most significant contributions: [Yes/No Philosophy](https://www.yesornophilosophy.com/) [(1)](https://curi.us/1917-rejecting-gradations-of-certainty) [(2)](https://curi.us/1595-rationally-resolving-conflicts-of-ideas))
* I am regularly updating <https://xertrov.github.io/fi/> with notes and things I'm writing or thinking about.

I've come to realise the current site I have is pretty bad for higher volume stuff, and jekyll is bad in general for maintaining a library of criticism.
So I'm thinking about potential new things to use for a site.

I want to migrate everything, have a large amount of customizability WRT posting, and it should do comments well. Building stuff is okay if it's feasible.

Oh, and it shouldn't have silly issues like jekyll does (e.g. sorting a list of pages can fail if they don't all have a field, e.g. `date` in their frontmatter; it's hard to provide a default, and even if they are present on all pages, you can't sort them if some of them are `Date`s and some are `String`s b/c Ruby doesn't know how to sort them).
